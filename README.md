CMS.611/6.073 Creating Video Games (MIT Class) - Project 2 - Spring 2016
by Erin King, David Ricardo, and Richard Oates

# Instructions:
## Game Controls
- Use the left mouse button to spawn positive (+) charges.
- Use the right mouse button to spawn negative (-) charges.
- Particles with the same charge repel each other, and particles with opposite charges attract.
- Pause, play, or speed up the simulation using the speed controls in the top right.

## Puzzle Mode
- The puzzle starts with the Quaffle (a designated particle) in an unreachable location.
- Arrange your particles so that the Quaffle moves into the goal hexagon.
- Number of available charges of each type are indicated in the top right info box.

## Sandbox Mode
- Click all over the place.
- Go crazy.
- Try putting a bunch of like-charged particles on the same spot and then one opposite-charged particle nearby. See what happens.
- Make your CPU super slow and unhappy.
- You are limited to 100 particles of each type so your computer doesn't die.
- The Phydditch team is not responsible if your computer dies anyway.
